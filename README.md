##Description:-

Suppose you are on a diet, and your friend gives you a very delicious cake to eat. Now you want to eat it but you can't (remember you are on a diet). But what if it's been many days since you ate something very fatty. But you don't know what you ate in last 2 or 3 days.

Diet-Track to the rescue. Diet-track stores your food history for past as many days as you want and shows you what you ate yesterday or the day before yesterday. This way you could save all you ate.

This is just a very basic version of a more advanced app which we are planning to create in future in which the user can see how much and what nutrient the user has eaten and also receive suggestions about what kind of food (s)he must eat in order to have a balanced diet.

The API for the web app has been deployed on openshift. The backend is written in node.js and uses mongoDB as database. We deployed our site completely on openshift only.


Built With: html, javascript, css, node.js, mongodb
